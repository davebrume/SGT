1. Planning
Goal: Create a program that allows teachers to input student names and grades, then calculates averages and assigns letter grades.

Scope: Small-scale console application for demonstration purposes.

Feasibility: Easy to build with Python, no external dependencies required.

2. Analysis
Requirements:

Input student names and grades.

Store grades in a structured format.

Calculate average scores.

Assign letter grades (A–F).

Display results in a clean format.

3. Design
Architecture:

Use a dictionary to store student data.

Functions for each major task (add student, calculate average, assign grade, display results).

Interface: Console-based, text input/output.
